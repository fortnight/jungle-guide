Jungle Guide
==============

This is, or will be a calculator. As I got into college-level math courses, I really felt 
like math is a jungle/rainforest kind of place where there are so many complex life forms;
mammals, reptiles, birds, plants, trees, bacteria, and perhaps some swamp zombies. As 
interesting as all these creatures are, they are dangerous enough to scare people out of
rainforests. Wolfram alpha felt like a jungle guide, like some bamf explorer who's traveled
the world over and has some crazy story of surviving on a deserted isle for eight years.
However, there was a day when my homework was too complex for him, and I had to figure out
how to live in this beautiful but bizarre landscape where everything can and will kill you.

I'm sure we all know that love is a battefield, but math, math is a deep and infinitely vast
jungle.
